## What's the difference?

The original repo was simply a proof of concept for running local terminal in browsers. However, the original solution does not provide a solution to connect multiple instances of terminal at the same time. I.e. different tabs will be connected to the same terminal. Some simple modifications to the code makes it supports multiple instances very well (I hope).

## Install, any other questions.

Refer to the original repo :D. All there is here is just some simple modifications to make multi-instances works. Maybe if there's bug I'll look into it.
